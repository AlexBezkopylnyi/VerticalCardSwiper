# ShazamDiscoverUI
_Replicating the Shazam Discover UI with UICollectionView in Swift._

<hr>

The goal of this project is to recreate the Discover UI in Shazam (which I think is a great, fun way to display content).

*Example:*

It's built with a `UICollectionView` and a custom flowLayout. This way, it works exactly the same as a normal `UICollectionView`.

Feel free to submit a pull request or fork this project. Any help on improving this is always appreciated.
